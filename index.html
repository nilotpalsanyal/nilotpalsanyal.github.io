        <h3>Ponderable quotes from great scientists</h3>
          
        ...rational is not always the spirit in science..

        <div class="quote-container"><blockquote class="quote">
          "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents 
          and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents
          eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with 
          it ...

          An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually
          winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that 
          Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually 
          die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the 
          ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the 
          future lies with the youth."

          idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit.
          But its very simplicity and the great ease which it has lent to
          computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful 
          inventions; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of the achievement

        <bq>Sign up for a course with yourself:
        Whatever courses you may take, do not ever forget to sign up for a course with yourself. Attend your class everyday. Hear yourself speaking attentively. Try to understand yourself, take notes by all means, ask questions to yourself, follow your answers carefully, get things clarified by further discussions with yourself. Do daily homeworks assigned by yourself. Get them checked by yourself. Sometimes make jokes with yourself, humor yourself, but anyways respect yourself. Once in a while, sit for test set by yourself. Ask yourself for test suggestions for good preparation beforehand. If you don't do good in the test, do not simply blame yourself, but do consult with yourself regarding what the problem was. If necessary, get extra hours with yourself so that next time you may do good. The benefit of this course is that you get to become more close to yourself. If things turn well, eventually you become a true friend of yourself, and then you may have access to the secrets of yourself, that only yourself knows!<br>
