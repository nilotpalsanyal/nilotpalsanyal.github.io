**Ponderable quotes from great scientists**
	
...rational is not always the spirit in science..

	"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents 
	and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents
	eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with 
	it ...

	An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually
	winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that 
	Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually 
	die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the 
	ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the 
	future lies with the youth."

	- Max Planck, physict (1858-1947), in Scientific autobiography, 
	  1950, p. 33, 97

...mystery lies not only at the endpoints..	  

	"We used to think that if we knew one, we knew two, because one and 
	one are two. We are finding that we must learn a great deal more 
	about 'and'."
	
	- Arthur Eddington, astronomer, physicist, mathematician (1882-1944)

...do you really 'see' it?

	"A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you 
	have made it so clear that you can explain it to the first man 
	whom you meet on the street." 

	- cherishingly quoted by David Hilbert, mathematician (1862-1943) 
	from Joseph-Diez Gergonne (1771–1859).

...didn't you get this hunch?

	"The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are
	beyond reason."

	- Blaise Pascal, mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher,
	writer, and Catholic theologian (1623-1662)

...doesn't this ring a deep-sounding bell?

	"No, no, you are not thinking, you are just being logical."

	- Niels Bohr, physicist (1885-1962), [in response to those who made
	purely formal or mathematical arguments, as quoted in What Little I
	Remember (1979) by Otto Robert Frisch, p. 95)

...the sign of sincerity, the sound of honesty

	"I speak from my present level of ignorance. The more you know, the
	more ignorant you become, because ignorance grows exponentially - the
	more answers you get, the more new questions arise."

	- Itzhak Bentov, scientist, inventor, mystic and author (1923-1979)

...there is only continuum of knowledge, subjects are man-made for convenience...never to forget

	"It seems plain and self-evident, yet it needs to be said: the 
	isolated knowledge obtained by a group of specialists in a narrow 
	field has in itself no value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis 
	with all the rest of knowledge and only inasmuch as it really
	contributes in this synthesis toward answering the demand, 
	"Who are we?""

	- Erwin Schrodinger, physicist (1887-1961), in "Science and 
	Humanism" (1951)

	"If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of 
	wine, this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, 
	astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that nature does not 
	know it!"

	- Richard Feynman, physicist (1918-1988). From The Feynman Lectures 
	on Physics (1964), Vol 1, Ch 3 ("The Relation of Physics to Other
	Sciences"), Sec 3-7 ("How did it get that way?")

...founding contributions of India

	"It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all
	numbers by means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of
	position as well as an absolute value; a profound and important 
	idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit.
	But its very simplicity and the great ease which it has lent to
	computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful 
	inventions; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of the achievement 
	the more when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes 
	and Apollonius, two of the greatest men produced by antiquity."

	- Pierre-Simon Laplace, French scholar and polymath (1749-1827). 
	Quoted in H Eves Return to Mathematical Circles (Boston 1988).

...there is only one sense, the common sense

	"All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday
	thinking."

	- "Physics and Reality" in the Journal of the Franklin Institute 
	Vol. 221, Issue 3 (March 1936)
