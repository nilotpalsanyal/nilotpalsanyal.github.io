Hello, I am Nilotpal Sanyal. Welcome to the my webpage. Have a look around. Make yourself comfortable.

I am professionally a statistician / bio-statistician, currently working on

- *High-dimensional methods for competing risks data with cure fraction.* 
- *Non-local prior mixtures for data with highly dispersed effect sizes.* 

Alongside academic research I have multifarious interests (as you can see above). Feel
free to explore, comment and [connect](../connect/index.html).
