Whatever courses you may take, do not ever forget to sign up for a course with yourself. Attend your class everyday. Hear yourself speaking attentively. Try to understand yourself, take notes by all means, ask questions to yourself, follow your answers carefully, get things clarified by further discussions with yourself. Do daily homeworks assigned by yourself. Get them checked by yourself. Sometimes make jokes with yourself, humor yourself, but anyways respect yourself. Once in a while, sit for test set by yourself. Ask yourself for test suggestions for good preparation beforehand. If you don't do good in the test, do not simply blame yourself, but do consult with yourself regarding what the problem was. If necessary, get extra hours with yourself so that next time you may do good. The benefit of this course is that you get to become more close to yourself, if things turn well, eventually you become a true friend of yourself, and then you may have access to the secrets of yourself, that only yourself knows!<br>
