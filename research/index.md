#### Overview

My research combines **method development**, **data analysis** and **software development**. I like to work in both the **classical/frequentist** and the **Bayesian** frameworks. I enjoy developing **computationally efficient** **statistical/bio-statistical** and **machine learning** methods and software for **high-dimensional data**. My research has found applications in **public health**, **omics**, **epidemiology** and **neuroscience**.

#### Specific research areas

- **Methods for gene by environment (GxE) interaction analysis.** Such methods help to understand how environmental factors (say, pollution) and lifestyle factors (say, smoking) may modify the effect of genetic factors on the outcome (say, lung cancer).

- **Methods for high-dimensional inference and variable selection.** Such methods are extremely useful for sparse data that contain a large number of features (e.g., public health data), often much larger than the number of observations (e.g., GWAS data, or gene expression data), where only a few features have significant effects.

- **Methods for survival data analysis in presence of competing risks.** Such methods help to predict the risk of the event (say, death) due to the primary cause of interest (say, cardio-vascular disease) correctly by accounting for the presence of other causes (say, accident) that may lead to the same event.<br> [Note that if we simply exclude from sample the persons who die from accident, we lose the information that those persons do not die from cardio-vascular disease up to the time of their accident. A competing risks model incorporates this information.]  

- **Methods for survival data analysis in presence of cure fraction.** Such methods help to account explicitly for the presence of possibly cured persons (say, long-time meditators) in the population who may never experience the event of interest (say, depression).

- **Methods for multiscalar data.** Such methods are useful for data that may contain information at multiple scales or resolution levels (say, image data or areal data) by virtue of the implicit multiscalar nature of the process (say, fMRI brain activation) and/or availability of information at multiple scales (say, time series data).

I have developed/co-developed the R software packages [GWASinlps](https://nilotpalsanyal.github.io/GWASinlps/), [BHMSMAfMRI](https://nilotpalsanyal.github.io/BHMSMAfMRI/) and [CGEN](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CGEN.html) based on my research. See [Software](../software/index.html) tab for more details.
